# Learn To App

An attempt to teach a non-coder to make the app they dream of with Ionic Framework.

## Requirements

A Mac... because I'm making this for one very specific person and they have a Mac and no coding experience and barely ever used a computer before.

## Objectives

- Command line
    + Git
    + Brew
    + nodejs
    + npm
    + ionic

- Concepts
    + googling thing
    + how to read and use documentation

Overall, this will teach a person to use the basic workings of Ionic, not to create anything custom, but will push them in that direction in the end.

## Why Ionic?

One could make an app for any device with Ionic. Since so many technologies are all packaged up into a single framework, it seems, for beginners, to be the most direct way to make an extremely basic app.

Overall, I hope that Ionic could be a good 'gateway drug' into development, whether it be web development or native app development is up to the student.
